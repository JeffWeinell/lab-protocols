### Materials

| NAP component | Amount/500mL NAP | Amount/1L NAP |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| EDTA disodium salt | 3.72 g |   |
| Sodium citrate trisodium salt dihydrate | 3.68 g  |   |
| Ammonium sulfate | 350 g |   |
| Ultra-purified, molecular grade water | 500ml |   |
| H2SO4 | varies | varies |

### Equipment
- Scale
- Weigh boats
- Magnetic stir rod, sterilized with 70% ethanol
- Hot plate
- pH reader or strips
- glass flask, autoclaved
- Secondary containment container (sterile nalgene bottle)

### Protocol

Combine EDTA, sodium citrate trisodium salt dihydrate, ammonium sulfate, and ultrapure water in glass flask. Use separate weigh boats for each chemical.
Add sterilized magnetic stir rod flask and stir on low/med heat until the salts dissolve completely. Turn off the hot plate and remove the buffer from the plate. Cool to room temperature.
Adjust pH to 5.2 with H2SO4 using the pH meter.
Store at room temperature or keep refrigerated until aliquoted.
Aliquot 1.5 mL of buffer into 2 mL tubes for preservation of up to 150 mg of sliced tissue.

as needed to adjust pH to 5.2
