### Materials

| NAP component | Amount/500mL NAP | Amount/1L NAP |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| EDTA disodium salt | 3.72g | 7.44g |
| Sodium citrate trisodium salt dihydrate | 3.68g  |  7.35g |
| Ammonium sulfate | 350g | 700g |
| Ultra-purified, molecular grade water | 500mL | 1L |
| H2SO4 | varies | varies |

### Equipment

- scale
- weigh boats
- magnetic stir rod, sterilized with 70% ethanol
- hot plate
- pH reader or strips
- glass flask, autoclaved
- sterile nalgene or glass bottle (500mL or 1L)

### Protocol

1. Combine EDTA, sodium citrate trisodium salt dihydrate, ammonium sulfate, and ultrapure water in flask. Use separate weigh boats for each chemical.
2. Add sterilized magnetic stir rod flask and stir on low/med heat until the salts dissolve completely. 
3. Cool to room temperature.
4. Adjust pH to 5.2 with H2SO4.
5. Transfer to sterile nalgene or glass bottle and store at room temperature or keep refrigerated until aliquoted.

### Usage

Aliquot 1.5mL of buffer into 2mL tubes for preservation of up to 150mg of sliced tissue.
