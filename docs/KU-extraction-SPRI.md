## KU SPRI Bead DNA Extraction Protocol

**Protocol modified slightly from [Phyletica Lab Protocols - SPRI Bead DNA Extraction Protocol](http://phyletica.org/lab-protocols/extraction-spri.html).**

### Reagents
- Proteinase K 20mg/mL (CAS 39450-01-6)
- Use either of the following as the buffer for the Lysis steps:
  - [Proteinase K Buffer Solution](https://phyletica.github.io/lab-protocols/pro-k.html)
  - [Promega Tissue Lysis Buffer](https://www.promega.com/products/nucleic-acid-extraction/genomic-dna/tissue-lysis-buffer-tla/?catNum=A5091) (catalog number: A5091)
- Use either of the following as the elution buffer for Isolation steps:
  - [TLE Buffer Solution](https://phyletica.github.io/lab-protocols/tle.html)
  - [Promega Elution Buffer](https://www.promega.com/products/forensic-dna-analysis-ce/dna-isolation/elution-buffer/?catNum=A8281) (catalog number: A8281)
- [Speedbeads](https://baddna.uga.edu/Protocols/Speedbead_Protocol_June2016.docx)
- 70% ETOH

### Equipment
- [Magnet Stand](https://www.shapeways.com/product/ZT777WRDC/new-and-improved-12-tube-mag-stand-v2?optionId=57997553)
- [Adjustable tip spacing multichannel pipette](https://www.shoprainin.com/Products/Pipettes-and-Tips/Pipettes/Adjustable-Spacer-Manual-Pipettes/Pipet-Lite-XLS/Pipet-Lite-Adjustable-Spacer-LA6-1200XLS/p/17011840)

### Procedure
#### 1) Lysis
1. Prepare lysis master mix containing 20 µL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K and 280 µL Proteinase K Buffer Solution (or Promega Tissue Lysis Buffer) per sample plus a little extra to account for pipetting error.
2. Add 300 µL of lysis master mix to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing up to 20 mg of sample tissue (approximately the size of a grain of rice).
3. Incubate samples at 55ºC in incubator overnight.

#### 2) Isolation
**Note:** At least 30 minutes before starting, put 70% ETOH in ETOH-safe freezer.
1. Allow Speedbead solution to warm to room temperature and mix by gently inverting the solution. Mix until beads are no longer sticking to the bottom of the tube. Before using beads, allow any bubbles that have been introduced by mixing to escape from the solution.
2. Add 300 µL of bead solution to tube containing lysis product.
3. Mix sample by flicking tube or tip-mixing (DO NOT VORTEX).
4. Briefly centrifuge to collect sample in bottom of tube.
5. Let sample sit for 5 minutes.
6. Place sample on magnet for 5 minutes or until all beads have collected on magnet and solution is clear.
7. Remove and dispose of solution without disturbing the beads on the magnet.
8. Add 1 mL of 70% ETOH.
9. Let sit for 1 minute.
10. Remove and dispose of ethanol without disturbing the beads on the magnet.
11. If large amount of tissue debris is present in solution, repeat steps 8–10.
12. Briefly centrifuge sample at low speed; return to magnet; collect and dispose residual ethanol without disturbing beads.
13. Dry sample (tube lid open) on heat block at 37ºC for approximately 5 minutes. Be careful not to overdry.
14. Add 200 µL 1X TE buffer (or Promega Elution Buffer) and flick tube to mix beads into solution until they are no longer sticking to side of tube. If beads are still stuck to side of tube, use a pippette with pippette tip to gently scrape and wash beads into the solution.
15. Briefly centrifuge to collect solution in bottom of tube.
16. Warm sample at 37ºC for 5 minutes.
17. Return to magnet for 5 minutes.
18. Transfer as much of the elution solution as possible without disturbing beads into new labelled tube.
19. Repeat steps 15–18 if large amount of beads in solution.
