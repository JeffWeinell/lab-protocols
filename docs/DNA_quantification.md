## DNA Quantification Protocol

This protocol is a more specific version of [this](https://github.com/JeffWeinell/lab-protocols/blob/main/QuantiFluor%20ONE%20dsDNA%20System%20Quick%20Protocol%20FB200.pdf) protocol provided by Quantus.

### Reagents and Equipment
- QuantiFlour ONE dsDNA System (Cat.# E4870/E4871), which includes:
  -  DNA Dye
  -  Lambda DNA standard (400ng/µL)
- Quantus Flourometer (Cat.# E6150)
- thin-walled 0.5mL PCR tubes (Cat.# 4941)
- DNA samples to quantify

### Procedure
1. Warm all reagents and samples to room temperature.
2. Label PCR tubes, 1 for each sample, plus 1 for the Blank and 1 for the Standard.
3. Add 200µL DNA Dye to each labelled PCR tube.
4. Prepare standard: Add 1µL Lambda DNA (400ng/µL) to the Standard.
5. Prepare unknown samples: add 1µL DNA to corresponding PCR tube.
6. Briefly vortex and then spin down PCR tubes.
7. Place PCR tubes in the dark for 5 minutes at room temp.
8. Set/check that the flourometer protocol = "ONEDNA", and sample volume = 1µL.
9. Calibrate flourescence for the Blank and Standard. (Additional Sanity check: measure the DNA concentration of the Standard, which should be 400ng/µL if the flourometer settings are correct).
10. Measure flourescence and record DNA concentrations of unknown samples.
