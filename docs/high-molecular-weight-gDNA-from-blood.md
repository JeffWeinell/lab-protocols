### Sampling and preserving high molecular weight genomic DNA in blood (serum, citrated plasma, or EDTA/blood).

### Get blood
On an open animal that has been anesthetized with sodium pento or isoflurane (so that the heart is still whirring along), immediately collect blood samples via direct anterior vena cava venipucture or alternatively by cardiac puncture.
While someone else processes the animal further (including collecting additional tissues for RNA), immediately processes blood sample(s) using one of the methods below to obtain high molecular weight DNA in blood serum, citrated plasma, or EDTA-blood solution.

### DNA in serum
Draw blood free of any anticoagulant.
Immediately, gently express blood into a centrifuge tube and allow to clot for 90 minutes at room temp.
Run a wooden applicator stick or clean toothpick gently along the tube wall once to dislodge clot from tube wall.
Centrifuge at 800rcf for 10 minutes.
Carefully transfer serum supernatant to new tube without upsetting the clot pellet.
Snap freeze blood serum.

### DNA in citrated plasma
Draw 4.2% sodium citrate into the syringe to fill 10% of the syringe volume, then draw the blood to fill the rest of the syringe volume (e.g. .1 cc of citrate and .9cc of blood).
Gently expel citrate/blood into a centrifuge tube and gently tilt a few times to mix.
Spin citrate/blood solution at 800rcf for 10 minutes.
Carefully transfer supernatant (citrated plasma) into a new tube without upsetting the white platelet boundary layer.
Snap freeze citrated plasma.

### DNA in EDTA-blood mixture
To the tube containing blood, add an equal volume of EDTA (0.5M, ph 8) to obtain a mixture 50/50 volume ratio of EDTA/blood.
Gently mix solution.
Snap freeze EDTA-blood sample.
