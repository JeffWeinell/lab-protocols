### Sampling and preserving high molecular weight genomic DNA in blood serum and citrated blood plasma

### Get two blood samples
On an open animal that has been anesthetized with sodium pento or isoflurane (so that the heart is still whirring along), immediately collect blood samples via direct anterior vena cava venipucture or alternatively by cardiac puncture.
Get citrated plasma from the first blood sample and serum from the second blood sample (see below), while someone else collects additional tissues for RNA and then processes the specimen further.

### Get serum from first blood sample 
Draw blood free of any anticoagulant.
Immediately, gently express blood into a centrifuge tube and allow to clot for 90 minutes at room temp.
Run a wooden applicator stick or clean toothpick gently along the tube wall once to dislodge clot from tube wall.
Centrifuge at 800rcf for 10 minutes.
Carefully transfer serum supernatant to new tube without upsetting the clot pellet.
Snap freeze blood serum.

### Get citrated plasma from second blood sample
Draw 4.2% sodium citrate into the syringe to fill 10% of the syringe volume, then draw the blood to fill the rest of the syringe volume (e.g. .1 cc of citrate and .9cc of blood).
Gently expel citrate/blood into a centrifuge tube and gently tilt a few times to mix.
Spin citrate/blood solution at 800rcf for 10 minutes.
Carefully transfer supernatant (citrated plasma) into a new tube without upsetting the white platelet boundary layer.
Snap freeze citrated plasma.
