## Plating and packaing samples for GeneWiz Sanger Sequencing

Protocol is for 96 PCR samples sequenced in forward and reverse directions.

### Materials
  - Three 96-well semi-skirted plates. 
  - Strip-caps for plates
  - Four pieces of carboard or similarly rigid material about the size of the plates
  - Aluminum foil
  - PCR product: 20µL (or diluted to reach this amount)
  - Forward primer (5µM): 20µL/sample
  - Reverse primer (5µM): 20µL/sample
  
### Procedure
Note: if different forward or reverse primers are to be used for different samples, primer well positions must correspond with sample well positions.
1. Add 20µL PCR product to each well of one of the plates.
2. Add 20µL 5µM forward primer to wells of second plate.
2. Add 20µL 5µM reverse primer to wells of third plate.
